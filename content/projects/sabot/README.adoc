:showtitle:

"`A sabot /ˈsæboʊ/ is a device used in a firearm or cannon to fire a projectile, such as a bullet, that is smaller than the bore diameter, or which must be held in a precise position.`"

Sabot is an environment-aware CDI Extension used to fire configuration into your applications with extreme precision.
It also happens to be the name of the awesome CDI spec-lead, https://twitter.com/antoine_sd[Antoine Sabot-Durand],
who wrote the core code this small project is based upon.

Future revisions may be donated or merged in with http://tamaya.incubator.apache.org/[Apache Tamaya].

Java EE 6 or higher required.  Optional dependency on Apache TomEE 1.0 or higher.

== @Inject @Config

The core concept is configuration data can be injected into your applications via `@Inject` with a simple `@Config` qualifier that names a property whose value you require.

The Properties themselves can come from `java.lang.System.getProperties()` using -D[property name]=[property value] on the command line, properties added to a `WEB-INF/classes/base.properties` file or
(optionally for TomEE users) in the `conf/system.properties` file of your server.

[source,java]
----
@Inject
@Config(value = "greeting")
private String greeting;

@Inject
@Config(value = "color", defaultValue = "orange")
private String color;

@Inject
@Config(value = "base", defaultValue = "${user.dir}")
private File userDir;

@Inject
@Config(value = "home", defaultValue = "${user.home}")
private File defaultFile;

@Inject
@Config(value = "service.timeout", defaultValue = "2 hours and 54 minutes")
private Duration timeout;

@Inject
@Config(value = "service.enabled", defaultValue = "false")
private Boolean enabled;

@Inject
@Config(value = "tx.retry")
private Integer retry;

== Custom Configuration

There are various ways of customizing the configuration for differing environments. You can:

* Add a 'test.properties' file to your test resources to override values found in the 'base.properties' file.
* Add additional property file names via the System property 'org.tomitribe.sabot.environment' (Constant ConfigurationResolver.ENVIRONMENT)
** -Dorg.tomitribe.sabot.environment=prod,dev - Sabot would then load the 'prod.properties' and 'dev.properties' files in that order.
* Create a configuration observer and add to to the classpath - You can use the TomEEConfiguration.java as your starting point.
[source,java]
----
@Singleton
public class YourConfiguration implements ConfigurationObserver {

    static {
        //This must occur before anything is initialized
        ConfigurationResolver.registerConfigurationObserver(new YourConfiguration());
    }
....
@Override
    public void mergeConfiguration(final Properties resolved) {
        ....[merge or override the configuration]
    }

== Custom Java Types

Sabot does *not* use `java.beans.PropertyEditor` implementations by default like other String-to-Java libraries do.

After 20 years of Java's existence, it's safe to say two styles dominate converting a `String` into a Java object:

 * A *Constructor* that take a single String as an argument.  Examples:
 ** `java.io.File(String)`
 ** `java.lang.Integer(String)`
 ** `java.net.URL(String)`
 * A *static method* that returns an instance of the same class.  Examples:
 ** `java.util.regex.Pattern.compile(String)`
 ** `java.net.URI.create(String)`
 ** `java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.valueOf(String)`


Use either of these conventions and Sabot will have no problem instantiating your object with the user-supplied `String` from the command-line args.

This should cover *95%* of all cases, but in the event it does not, you can create a `java.beans.PropertyEditor` and register it with the JVM.
Use your Google-fu to learn how to do that.

The order of precedence is as follows:

 1. Constructor
 2. Static method
 3. `java.beans.PropertyEditor`
